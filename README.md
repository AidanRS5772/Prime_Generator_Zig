This uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes and bit level memory manipulation in Zig to create my take on a highly performant program that indexes every number in range as either prime or not prime. It can index the numbers from 1 too 1 Billion as prime or not prime in less the 8 seconds running on only 8Gb of Ram on an M1 processor!

It uses list of u128 where every bit in the array is the index of the number and that index is marked prime or not prime by the state of the bit. Each index repersents a number that is of the form 6n +/- 1. Then using some number theory we are able to reduce the space and time compleity of the algorithm by aproximatly 1/3. This along with Zig's ability to do high performance bit manipulations allows for the program to be so fast and be able to run on low end hardware for very large numbers.
